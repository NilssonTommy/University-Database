# University-Database

This project models a university database system designed to manage students, courses, departments, and academic programs. It provides functionality for student registration, academic progress tracking, and graduation eligibility checks. The backend is implemented in Java with a PostgreSQL database, using JDBC for database interaction. A minimal web interface is also included.
