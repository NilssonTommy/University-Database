The relations with a "*" (example *R) is the one that is not valid anymore.

*R(studentIdnr, studentName, login, branchName, programName, programAbbreviation, courseCode, courseName, credits, departmentName, departmentAbbreviation, capacity, classification, grade, position) 

Split R with studentIdnr
*R1(studentIdnr, studentName, login, branchName, programName, programAbbreviation)
*R2(studentIdnr, courseCode, courseName, credits, departmentName, departmentAbbreviation, capacity, classification, grade, position)

Split R1 with programName
R11(programName, programAbbreviation)
R12(studentIdnr, studentName, login, branchName, programName)

Split R2 with courseCode
*R21(courseCode, courseName, credits, departmentName, departmentAbbreviation, capacity)
*R22(studentIdnr, courseCode, classification, grade, position)

Split R21 with departmmentName
R211(departmentName, departmentAbbreviation)
R212(courseCode, courseName, credits, departmentName, capacity)

Split R22 with studentIdnr and courseCode
R221(studentIdnr, courseCode, grade, position)
R222(studentIdnr, courseCode, classification)


Which gives us:

R11(_programName_, programAbbreviation)


R12(_studentIdnr_, studentName, login, branchName, programName)
	(login)UNIQUE
	(programName->R11.programName)
	

R211(departmentName, departmentAbbreviation)
	(departmentAbbreviation)UNIQUE


R212(_courseCode_, courseName, credits, departmentName, capacity)
	(departmentName->R211.departmentName)


R221(_studentIdnr_, _courseCode_, grade, position)  (MVD)
	(courseCode, position)UNIQUE
	(studentIdnr->R12.studentIdnr)
	(courseCode-> R212.courseCode)


R222(_studentIdnr_, _courseCode_, _classification_) (MVD)
	(studentIdnr->R12.studentIdnr)
	(courseCode-> R212.courseCode)


The FD approach is successful until R22 is decomposed into R221 and R222, where R222 is an unuseful table with MVD. 
Same for R221.



R222(_studentIdnr_, _courseCode_, _classification_) is a MVD. 

studentIdnr ↠ courseCode
courseCode ↠ classification

R2221(_studentIdnr_, _courseCode_)
R2222(_courseCode_, _classification_)
